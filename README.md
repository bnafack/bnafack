## Side projects
### [Speech-to-Text Model Integration](https://github.com/Sueza-project/speechci)
• User Interface Development: Developed an intuitive user interface (UI) using
the React framework to collect audio input from users within the UI.

• API Communication: Established seamless communication with the back-end through
RESTful APIs to facilitate the translation process

.Speech-to-Text Model Integration: Integrated and deployed a fine-tuned speech-to-text
model on Linode cloud computing infrastructure.

• Cloud Deployment through Kubernetes: Employed Kubernetes cluster on Linode for
efficient deployment of the developed application and its components.

•Continuous Integration Setup: Implemented a robust continuous integration pipeline
using Jenkins to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes. Set up an Intel Developer Cloud computer instance to build, test, and push the docker image on the Docker hub. 

### [Speech data collection system](https://sueza.eparchemin.com/contribute)
• Developed a multilingual speech data collection system to facilitate
creation of an adaptive speech recognition system utilizing pre-trained models.
